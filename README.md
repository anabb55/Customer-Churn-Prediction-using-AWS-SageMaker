# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-AWS-SageMaker

#Project Overview#

The main idea behind this project was to explore the capabilities of AWS Cloud for developing and deploying a machine learning model. 
The goal was to predict customer churn (whether a customer will leave a service) and to compare a cloud-trained XGBoost model with a locally trained Logistic Regression model using the same dataset.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)##

I started by performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the datasetâ€™s structure, feature distributions and correlations.
